GridMap.cs
Allison Cuba and Penny Carver

The Grid Map creation the handling of adding and removing entities from the grid are good uses of the grid in my opinion. The only problem I see is
Penny's implementation of findCollision() does not use the nearby neighbor method of detecting collisions. Instead the entire grid looks for pairs of
collisions. This makes sense to me and how we handled our collisions in the entity classes but it is not a direct implementation of the grid method
of collisions.

I would suggest that it might be worth trying the nearby neighbor method. I am not sure that is it asymptotically a better method but it seems like it
might be because it only checks the 9 or so tiles around an entity instead of the entire grid but at the same time this elimates calling find collision
on each entity.
