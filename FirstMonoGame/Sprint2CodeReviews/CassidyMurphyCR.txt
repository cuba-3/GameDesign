I like how LevelLoader reads and initializes entities from the level.xml file.
It's also very nice not to have to declare all the entities inside of main anymore.
Also level loader can be reused for the future levels we make which was a good implementation.
But I don't like the long methods with lots of switch statements since this is considered a code smell.
This could easily be fixed though by breaking up each case of the switch statement into methods.

It took me about 15 minutes to complete this review.
