The first comment I have is that in DoCollision, there is a massive # of if statements. Considering that CollisionResponse is a class full of static methods for use in
telling enities how to respond to collisions, it might be better to try and put this logic into CollisionResponse (determining which entities are colliding and what 
should happen). Sprite being in charge of the bounding box is a good idea since we will need to have her box change to reflect her appearance when she's crouching later 
on. Changing the Sprite location with sprite sheet changes is interesting, and I'm not sure about how this will work when there is more complex moving, for example 
scrolling. If other avatars are added, it would be a good idea to reduce the size of Avatar Entity classes by taking the sprite sheets and placing them in the appropriate 
Sprite class.
