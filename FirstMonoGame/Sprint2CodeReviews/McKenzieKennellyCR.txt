CollisionResponse.cs

The CollisionResponse class is essentially just a bunch of helper methods. Everytime an entity collides with another entity, the method DoCollision() is called in each 
of the entities (each entity class has this method) is called. This method contains numerous if, else if, else statements to identify the item the 
entity is colliding with, and according to which one, the appropiate helper method in CollisionResponse is called. Helper methods in a seperate class are a good idea, or else
we would have had to put all of the methods in each individual entity class, which could have gotten really confusing. This could have resulted in the code smell: long classes.
The helper methods allow for all collision response possible cases to be implemented.

CollisionResponse is a really large class, and it could have been broken up differently or completley done with different logic. It is very
dependent on checking the bounding boxes of each entity, their intersection, and logical operations in if, else if, else statements. If any of the 
logical operations were done incorrectly, the collisions would not function properly.
