EndCutScene.cs
Cassidy Murphy
This cut screen occurs when Peach wins the second level, and jumps on the flag. When she does this,
she walks right and the entire glass ceiling breaks. The winner screen is then displayed with her 
status. She utilized a goal location and peach's location to make her walk a certain distance.
She also uses commands to make her actually move left and right depending on what way she is 
facing. Commands are how we originally discussed in class to do cut screens.

A change Cassidy could have done is paused the rest of the game when the end cut screen is 
occuring. For example, if Bowser is alive, he still moves during the cut screen. This is not
usually the functionality of a cut screen. Therefore, I think this would have made the 
cut screen cleaner.
