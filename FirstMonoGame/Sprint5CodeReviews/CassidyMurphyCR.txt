GradeRoomStates and CoinRoomStates
Mckenzie and Natalie

The coin and grade room states are good because they allow us to draw instructions on the screen
when peach eneters the minigames. It allows smooth transitions to each game state such as game over
and retarting as well. The game states also keep grades and coins from being generated
randomly when peach is in the above world which is good as well.

To improve these I think the instruction locations could have been stored as constants in the 
tconstants file. The same 8 locations are calculated in each one each time and saving them 
as constants would fix that.

Time Spent: 20 min.
