HealthBar.cs

The Health Bar entity works well in the level but gave me some implementation questions. First, the health bar is
and enemy entity, which doesn't make any sense because the health bar doesn't take damage from peach, it just displays
the damage that Bowser is taking. It is probably better off as an item or as it's own entity type. Additionally, as
Bowser is the final boss in the game, the use of Factory MIGHT not be necessary as each health bar level will only be used
once.
I would have made the health bar it's own entity type if I was planning on extending this game past this level, as there
would probably be other entities who might use the health bar, like Peach for instance and in that case the enemy type would
not  make sense.

Time Spent: 15 minutes
