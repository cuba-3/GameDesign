Mario.cs

To control mario's movements, we currently have a very large update method that sets his velocity every few seconds based on a Delay integer.

Time Spent on review: 15 minutes

When first looking at Mario.cs, I immediately noticed the Update method and all of the if-else if-else conditional statements.
This file undoubtedly has a high cyclomatic complexity because of this.  If we were to refactor this file, it would be better to have Mario action 
states that would set his velocity. This would also make it clearer to see what is happening to Mario each time his velocity is being reset.  
Currently, it is very difficult to see if Mario is walking, jumping, or falling, which also makes the file harder to Debug.
Making action states would also help us to randomize his movements very easily, because we could randomly call the different action states.
Mario also doesn't have gravity which would also remove the need to set his y velocity in a positive direction, forcing him to fall.
