It's curious to me that the intro cutscene actually has a Peach object as opposed to just using a Sprite. This could be really useful if the cutscene ended up involving
some sort of collisions, or gameplay-like scene. For this cutscene, you easily could have just programmed the animation changes and movements through
the state's Update and Draw. The strings in Draw should be placed in the Constant file, so that way they could be easily changed without messing with
the way the strings get drawn [font, location, etc.]. Though, a caveat of this is that there can't be too much of a difference in strings or else the Draw
method will have to be altered anyways. An advantage of using the actual Peach class vs just a Sprite is that you can use the Sprite factory to simplify anim logic.

It's also interesting that one timer is in seconds and the other in frames; the difference between using frames as a measure vs. seconds is usually not noticeable,
but if the game were to run slowly [or too fast somehow] there would be a difference.
