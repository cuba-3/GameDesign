ItemSprite.cs
Natalie Amling
The ItemSprite class is a little different than the other Sprite classes. Natalie chose to add parameters to the constructor, and the other sprites do not have parameters.
This is how she sets the texture, rows, columns, and location. This works for ItemSprite because none of the item entities have a state. In the Sprite Factory, the 
constructor is instantiated with all of the applicable parameters it needs for the item. Some of the methods that ItemSprite implements (because it implements ISprite)
were left empty because they did not need to be implemented to get the item sprites on the screen.

To remove the unimplemented methods from ItemSprite, Natalie could have made another interface for item sprites specifically.
