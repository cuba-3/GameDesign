Sprint 1
EnemySprite.cs
Natalie Amling
Right now, EnemySprite.cs does not support switching animations.  
Right now, this will function for Sprint 1 because the enemies don't have to be killed. 
However, they're really being treated as Items, which will become a problem when they need to transition into a dead state.
I also don't think that the EnemySprite constructor needs to be passed rowIndex and columnIndex.

Time Spent on review: 15 minutes

InitializeSprite also doesn't do anything right now. This is because our factories use the constructor to initialize it.
However, InitializeSprite is in the Sprite Interface, ISprite, so it has to be implemented in EnemySprite.
It seems like maybe we should be using a different interface for our avatar and our enemies.
