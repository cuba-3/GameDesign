Specific comments on code quality
In general the command files are pretty sucessful. The only issue I see is that the way the command files are set 
up right now, each command for Peach must check peaches actionstate and powerupstate before calling a transition.
Specifically in CrouchCommand, Execute() checks that Peach is not Dead, is Idle and is not Standard before calling
crouch transition.

Potentially we could have more Command files to support a simplar implementation for each execute. I'm not sure 
whether is would be better to consolidate the commands or keep Execute() simplar but it is an option going forward
if it gets more complicated.
