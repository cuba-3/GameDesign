Comments on Code Quality:
-Why is the property Texture public? It has a setter (ChangeTexture) and isn't accessed outside the AvatarSprite class
-The utility provided by public properties could be rewritten as methods that would be in ISprite and could be used for all implementing classes. CurrentLocation could
have a setter and thus be made into a private field, for example.
-The logic in Draw is really good; what would happen if we tried creating sprite sheets with more than one row for the same anim?
-SwitchAnimation, ChangeTexture, and SetFrame have very specific functionality; it works well for what we have sprite sheet-wise
-The Velocity vector is a nice field to have; it might be useful to create a method to add a vector to Velocity so that acceleration/deceleration can be made later on
-SetVelocity could just take a Vector instead of two ints with the vector components
-The debug method could probably be moved into a separate class for use in debugging or something, just so that it's not with the class method implementations

Potential Change to Game, Effect on Code:
A change to sprite animations that might take some careful thought on how to implement is an anim where the first i frames represent a non-looping "intro" anim, the second
j frames represent a looping "true" anim, and the last k frames represent a non-looping "end" anim, similar to the first i frames. Our current implementation can't do that, 
but we could change the start and end frames for a singular anim on the sprite sheet and change the Draw logic accordingly.
