The game state implementation is done very well. This way the current game state
can be checked to keep us from running the game when the game isnt current in running mode. 
We can also use these to determine when to draw splash screens. It's a good use of state design
pattern. Also this way we can decide what exactly to do when the game transistions from one
state to the other.
