PlayerStats.cs
Cassidy Murphy
The PlayerStats class has an update and draw method that Peach's update and draw calls.
The methods draw the player stats to the screen and continiously updates them. Cassidy initialized
all fields. All updates for the fields are done in the update method. These fields are getters
and setters, so they can be accessed in other classes. The entirity of the HUD is drawn in the 
draw method. There are some helper methods in this class that allow for other classes to 
decrement/increment lives, pass checkpoints, or collect coins. These helper methods allow for
other classes, upon certain conditions, to easily change the necessary player stats, such as decrement
a life when an enemy collides with peach.

A change could be to clean up the logic in update. It is kind of messy, and that is because
a lot of different people contributed to it, including myself. Overall, the logic is
all necessary to update the player stats, but could be cleaner.
