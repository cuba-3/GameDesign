Code: PlayerStats.cs
Author: McKenzie Kennelly, Cassidy Murphy

The PlayerStats class does a really good job of keeping track of the player stats related to player manipulation of the avatar; it isn't coupled
to the Avatar class. The sprite code could maybe be part of a HUD class if the class were to get too complicated. I like that the player's avatar and
other aspects of the game are part of the constructor so you could use the class in more than one way. There are some assets being loaded in the class,
though, that are specific to Peach. If we changed the game to have different selectable characters, like at the start of the game or something, we'd
have to refactor it so that the resources come from the avatar and are used or they're triggered elsewhere.
