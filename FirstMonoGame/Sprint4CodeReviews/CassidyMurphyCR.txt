AscendCommand.cs/DescendCommand.cs
Natalie and Allison

The code for Descend command is basically not used anymore, it looks like there used to be code in it that was taken out and placed
in Peach Update(). There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason as to which information is handled in the commands and what is handled
in Update().

In the future I would suggest refactoring to pull all possible pieces of the command into the Command files and only leaving necessary
parts in DoCollision and in Update. Specifically the Ascending and Descending bool can be set in the corresponding command files.

Time Spent: 10 min.
