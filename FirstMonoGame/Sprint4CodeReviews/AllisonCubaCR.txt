To save peach's state at a checkpoint, we currently use collision response and pass Peach's location to 
CurrentStats, which is a method in PlayerStats.  This is also how we make warp pipes checkpoints.  

Time Spent on review: 15 minutes

This should be refactored to use the Memento Design Pattern.  Currently, only Peach's 
location is preserved in CurrentStats.  I think that it could be really beneficial to preserve some more
information, such as her PowerUpState.  In Sprint 5, when Peach gets reset to a checkpoint, we will probably need to 
know more than just her location.  For example, we might need to be able to tell if she has achieved 
certain bonuses because these will effect the sprites sheets and Peach's actions.  If we use the memento design pattern,
we could make all of these attributes originators.
