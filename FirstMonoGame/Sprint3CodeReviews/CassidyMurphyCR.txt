GridMap.cs

GridMap does a pretty good job at managing the objects and the grid, but when
the grid is created it uses the viewport as the limits instead of the entire
level. This means that anything outside the viewport but part of the level
just doesn't collide, ever. Also, if objects move fast or collide with lots of
things collision detection should be more involved than just seeing if bounding
boxes intersect. Also, if we add lots of nonmoving objects in the same spot it makes
the game completely unresponsive, so we need to find a way to reduce checks.
