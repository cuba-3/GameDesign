The logic for keys being pressed, held and released makes sense. 
It would be a good idea to put the key states with the key and command so that 
commands can be broken down into singular calls versus command classes 
having multiple methods. Later, action states could go with them too. 
Commands would be simpler this way. If we added the ability to control 
height of jump by how long the jump button is held, we would need to be able 
to keep adding velocity while Peach is jumping and the button is being held.
