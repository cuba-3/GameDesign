LevelLoader.cs

Inside of LevelLoader there is some repeated code inside of the 
AddBlock method.  Question block and brick Block both register any hidden
items that they contain in the same way.  This is obviously repetitive
and the mehtod also has a very high cyclomatic complexity.  

Time Spent on review: 15 minutes

Perhaps we could initialize brickblock and questionblock outside of the
switch case.  Or, we might be able to set a bool to true, indicating
that these blocks do have hidden items.  Then outside of the switch case, we could
say that if a block has children, add them in the same for loop structure that
is currently being impelemented.
