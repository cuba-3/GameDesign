ExplodingBlock.cs and CollisionResponse.cs(specifically brick block's response)
Allison Cuba

The process of handling an exploding brick block is kind of confusing in general. Instead of the pieces of 
the exploded block being created when the the brick is bumped by a large scale Peach, the pieces are children
of the exising brick block and are revealed like an item from the brick block as the brick block is deregistered
and taken off screen. I don't think this necessarily a problem but it seems like overloading the meaning of a
child in the xml, it seems like that should only be used for items contained.

I would suggest creating the instances of each exploded piece upon the call to explode the block in 
CollisionResponse. I would call the spritefactory method to create 4 exploded brick pieces.
