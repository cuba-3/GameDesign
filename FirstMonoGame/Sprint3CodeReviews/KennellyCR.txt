CollisionResponse.cs​
Natalie Amling​
Natalie spent a lot of time refactoring this class, but I feel​
as though the methods could be simplified.  For example, BrickBlockCollision ​
has six nested if statements. This risks a high cyclomatic complexity. While debugging, we also descovered​
that some of these conditions do not have the outcome that we wanted while writing ​
them. ​Natalie's refactor makes it diffcult to account for every collision condition.

One way that we could simplify this method, is the way that hidden items​
inside of blocks are handled.  If the entity coming out of the block is a SuperMushroom,​
a OneUpMushroom, or a Star, the resulting code is nearly identical in all three cases.​
To eliminate this, we could either combine these cases, set the velocity inside of the ​
Entity's class, or make a seperate method that handles these conditions.
